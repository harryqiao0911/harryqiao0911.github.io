### My story

I was born in Beijing and spent my first fourteen years there, going to Chinese and international schools. Just before I started 9th grade, my family immigrated to the United States. Ninth grade was somewhat difficult for me because my English was not perfect and it was quite a culture shock to come from our life in Beijing surrounded by realtives to a new city and a new country, with no close relatives nearby. But after almost 4 years at Horace Mann, I have become perfectly bilingual in Mandarin and English and at home in both worlds.
