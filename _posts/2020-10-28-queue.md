'''
Let’s suppose that I own a bookstore, and due to space constraints, only 10 people can be in the store at a time. 
There’s enough space outside for 25 people to wait in line. 
For the sake of ease, suppose that a person is just an integer. 
Write a Bookstore class (that uses Queue) that handles:
Who is in the store and who is in line
What happens when someone enters or leaves the store/line
What happens when the line/store is full
Implement the Queue class using two Stacks.
