*   Identify a statistical question that you could ask.

    I want to investigate the impact of college majors on color preferences. I hypothesize that students who study an art major would have a different color preference after completing college degree. 

*   Identify the population you would study to answer the question. What information about the population would help answer your question?

    The population I would study to answer the question would be everyone in the United States that will enroll in college. General information such as the overall color preferences, and educational background would be helpful for this study. 

*   Identify a feasible sample frame, and explain your reasoning.

    In order to conduct this study, the sampled individual needs to have a cell phone number or email address for communication purposes. Therefore the sample frame would be everyone in the population that has a cell phone number or an email address documented. 

*   Identify the sampling method you would use, and explain your reasoning. What makes this method better than the others?

    For this study, Stratified sampling would be used to obtain samples from the sample frame. Because I want to study the effect of majoring in art on color preferences, stratified sampling would guarantee a certain number of students intended to major in art. 

*   Suppose you had the means to run an experiment on this sample. Identify the null and alternative hypotheses.

    Null hypothesis: study a art major does not have a impact on color preferences.
    Alternative hypotheses: study a art major does have a impact on color preferences.
    
*   Identify the variables and treatments that would provide information about your question. 
Explain your choice of treatments.

    Intended major, actually major, color preferences (depends on the complexity of the survey, can include more than one variable). The treatment would be an actual college major. 

*   Identify the treatment groups, and how each subject would be assigned to a group.

    The treatment group would be the group of students who will major in an art subject. Initially, groups can be assigned based on the intended college major. Since most colleges does not require students to declare a major until the end of freshman year or sophomore year, the group can be adjusted according to the declared major.

*   Briefly discuss how the experiment would be conducted.

    For every subject in the sample, a survey would be sent out before they enter college. The survey would ask for their intended major as well as questions associated with color preference. After the students graduate from college, they would be asked to complete a survey that asks their major and the same set of questions associated with color preference. 

*   What biases may come up, and how would you address them?

    Different colleges have different art programs and courses and might impact the students color preference differently. Stratified sampling can create patterns that arenâ€™t reflected in the population. To address this issue, I can slightly modify the stratified sampling method by using interval sampling within each stratified group. This way, by labeling the student in school (alphabetical) order, no school will be over/underrepresented.
