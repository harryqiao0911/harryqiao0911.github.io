# My Process

### My Method

In this lab, I found average sepal width and petal length of the three different species of iris by using the knowledge I learned in class. In my code, I used the csv module as well as variables, lists, and loops. To find the average sepal width and petal length, I needed to account for the data of each individual of a species by adding them up and dividing by the total number of that species. The first idea that came to my mind was to use a loop. Using the csv module, I opened and read the iris data set using the csv.reader() row by row. Since every row is read as a list, I could identify the type of species by checking the fifth column of the data set. Once a type of species was identified, I was able to convert the data in the second and third column from strings to float and add them to the variable that accounts for the sum. To find the average, I also incorporated a variable that kept the counts of each type of species. Everytime a species’s name was recognized, the count of that species increased by 1. At the end I was able to find the average by printing the sum of sepal width and petal length of the three different species divided by their count. 

### Set Backs

One thing that I didn’t quite understand is that when I converted the values from strings to floats and summed them up, I sometimes got a number with many decimal places. Since every value in the data set had exactly one decimal place, I expected their sum to have one decimal place as well. When I printed out sums to check, some gave me 14 decimal places, such as 170.90000000000003 for the sum of Iris-setosa sepal width. Although I don’t know what is causing this issue, I rounded the sums to one decimal place because 10 to the 14th power is negligible. I rounded the final result to three decimal places for the similar issue. 

# Result

By using the method above, I calculated the average sepal width and petal length of the three different species: 

Iris-setosa sepal width: 3.418
Iris-setosa petal length: 1.464
Iris-versicolor sepal width: 2.77
Iris-versicolor petal length: 4.26
Iris-virginica sepal width: 2.974
Iris-virginica petal length: 5.552

# Analysis and Conclusion
As the data table shows, Iris-virginica has the longest petals on average and Iris-setosa has the widest sepals on average. This lab could have gone better if I had been able to figure out what was causing the extra decimal places. It would be ideal if I could come up with a function that automatically compares the averages of sepal width and petal length and tells me which one is the largest. In this lab, I deepened my understanding of how to use the csv module and Python to investigate and experiment on a given data set. I also learned how to write code using Markdown.

# Code
```python
import csv

#initialize variables
Iris_setosa_petal_length = 0
Iris_setosa_sepal_width = 0
Iris_versicolor_petal_length = 0
Iris_versicolor_sepal_width = 0
Iris_virginica_petal_length = 0
Iris_virginica_sepal_width = 0
Iris_setosa_count = 0
Iris_versicolor_count = 0
Iris_virginica_count = 0

#read iris data set row by row
with open("iris.csv", "r") as f:
    data = csv.reader(f)
    for row in data:
    #for each identified species, add length and width to existing sum variable and add count by 1
        if row[4] == "Iris-setosa":
            Iris_setosa_petal_length = Iris_setosa_petal_length + float(row[2])
            Iris_setosa_sepal_width = Iris_setosa_sepal_width + float(row[1])
            Iris_setosa_count = Iris_setosa_count + 1
        elif row[4] == "Iris-versicolor":
            Iris_versicolor_petal_length = Iris_versicolor_petal_length + float(row[2])
            Iris_versicolor_sepal_width = Iris_versicolor_sepal_width + float(row[1])
            Iris_versicolor_count = Iris_versicolor_count + 1
        elif row[4] == "Iris-virginica":
            Iris_virginica_petal_length = Iris_virginica_petal_length + float(row[2])
            Iris_virginica_sepal_width = Iris_virginica_sepal_width + float(row[1])
            Iris_virginica_count = Iris_virginica_count + 1

#round sums to 1 decimal
Iris_setosa_petal_length = round(Iris_setosa_petal_length,1)
Iris_setosa_sepal_width = round(Iris_setosa_sepal_width,1)
Iris_versicolor_petal_length = round(Iris_versicolor_petal_length,1)
Iris_versicolor_sepal_width = round(Iris_versicolor_sepal_width,1)
Iris_virginica_petal_length = round(Iris_virginica_petal_length,1)
Iris_virginica_sepal_width = round(Iris_virginica_sepal_width,1)

#print sums to check progress
print(Iris_setosa_petal_length)
print(Iris_setosa_sepal_width)
print(Iris_versicolor_petal_length)
print(Iris_versicolor_sepal_width)
print(Iris_virginica_petal_length)
print(Iris_virginica_sepal_width)

#print average (sum/count) and round to 3 decimals
print("Iris-setosa sepal width average is: " + str(round(Iris_setosa_sepal_width/Iris_setosa_count,3)))
print("Iris-setosa petal length average is: " + str(round(Iris_setosa_petal_length/Iris_setosa_count,3)))
print("Iris-versicolor sepal width average is: " + str(round(Iris_versicolor_sepal_width/Iris_versicolor_count,3)))
print("Iris-versicolor petal length average is: " + str(round(Iris_versicolor_petal_length/Iris_versicolor_count,3)))
print("Iris-virginica sepal width average is: " + str(round(Iris_virginica_sepal_width/Iris_virginica_count,3)))
print("Iris-virginica petal length average is: " + str(round(Iris_virginica_petal_length/Iris_virginica_count,3)))
```
# Special Note

I worked individually on my code, but checked my experimental results with Alexis.
